      Welcome to my blog. I'm quite new to this so don't expect much
      yet when it comes to quality of the blog or the content. Especially
      since I'll be coding this from scrath as a project for HTML, CSS and
      most probably JavaScript as well. This is all new to me so I hope to
      improve as quickly as possible and that you enjoy the journey. <br />
      <br />
      I'll mostly be updating my progress with my coding here, but ontop of
      that I'll be uploading my cooking, recipes, streams and various other
      things I'll be doing in my life that I find either interesting or
      important. I will not just be posting for the sake of posting, so do not
      expect this to be updated every single day. This is more likely to be
      updated 3 or 4 times per month.

      There will be various other reason for me to update so that number I mentioned
      earlier might not even be true, who knows? I know I most cetainly don't.
      Well, this seems like a long enough length for a little introduction
      to this blog and what it's all about. I hope you're all having a great time
      Unaven out!
